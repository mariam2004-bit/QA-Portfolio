# Hi, I'm Mari — Junior Manual QA Tester

Welcome to my QA Portfolio.  
This repository includes my test documentation, practical tasks, and hands-on projects developed during my transition from theory to real-world QA practice.

## About Me
I am a motivated Manual QA Tester who has successfully transitioned from theory to hands-on practice through GenofIT’s QA Manual Pro program.

I am continuously strengthening my skills across multiple testing areas, including:

- Frontend testing  
- Backend testing  
- UI/UX evaluation  
- API validation (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

I specialize in creating clear and professional QA documentation aligned with ISTQB standards, such as:

- Test cases  
- Bug reports  
- Checklists

My current toolkit includes Jira (defect tracking), Postman, SQL (basic level), and Accessibility testing following WCAG guidelines.

I am actively building this GitHub portfolio to showcase:
- Real-world style QA projects  
- Strong attention to detail  
- Clear communication skills  
- Commitment to delivering reliable, user-centered digital products

My long-term goal is to grow into a skilled QA professional who contributes to building high-quality software products.
